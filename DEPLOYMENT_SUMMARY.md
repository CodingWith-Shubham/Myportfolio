## Deployment Architecture

```
Client (Browser) --> Vercel (Frontend) --> Vercel Serverless Functions (Backend) --> MongoDB Atlas
```

## How to Deploy

1. Commit and push your changes using the deployment scripts:
   - Windows: `deploy.bat "Your commit message"`
   - Mac/Linux: `./deploy.sh "Your commit message"`

2. Monitor the deployment on your Vercel dashboard

3. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel dashboard:
   - MONGODB_URI
   - JWT_SECRET
   - VITE_API_URL
   - Other application-specific variables

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the following:

1. Frontend application loads correctly
2. API endpoints are accessible
3. Database connections are working
4. Projects are displaying correctly
5. Contact forms are submitting properly
6. Images and media are loading

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Verify API URL in environment variables
   - Check CORS configuration

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MongoDB connection string
   - Ensure IP whitelist includes Vercel's servers

3. **Build Failures**:
   - Check Vercel build logs
   - Verify all dependencies are correctly listed in package.json

4. **Missing Environment Variables**:
   - Review Vercel dashboard settings
   - Ensure all required variables are defined
